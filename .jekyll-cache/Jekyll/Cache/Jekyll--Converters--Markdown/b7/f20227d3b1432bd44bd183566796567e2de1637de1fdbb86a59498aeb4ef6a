<ul>
  <li>Assume \(n\) subjects are sequenced in a region with ( p ) variant sites observed.</li>
  <li>Covariates might include age, gender, and top principal components of genetic variation for controlling population stratification.</li>
  <li>For the ( i )-th subject,
    <ul>
      <li>( y_i ) denotes the phenotype variable,</li>
      <li>( X_i = (X_{i1}, X_{i2}, â€¦, X_{im}) ) the covariates,</li>
      <li>( G_i = (G_{i1}, G_{i2}, â€¦, G_{ip}) ) the genotypes for the ( p ) variants within the region.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Typically, we assume an additive genetic model and let ( G_{ij} = 0, 1, ) or ( 2 ) represent the number of copies of the minor allele.</li>
  <li>Dominant and recessive models can also be considered.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, letâ€™s consider that we have sequenced 200 subjects and only have 10 variant sites in a particular genomic region. We have three covariates: age, gender, and the first principal component of genetic variation (PC1).</p>

<h2 id="linear-skat-model-and-test">Linear SKAT Model and Test</h2>

<p>To analyze this data using a statistical model, we consider the phenotype as a continuous trait, employing a linear model described by:</p>

<p>[
y_i = \alpha_0 + \alphaâ€™X_i + \betaâ€™G_i + \epsilon_i
]</p>

<ul>
  <li>( \alpha_0 ) is an intercept term,</li>
  <li>( \alpha ) is the vector of regression coefficients for the covariates,</li>
  <li>( \beta ) is the vector of regression coefficients for the genetic variants in the region.</li>
</ul>

<p>For dichotomous traits like blood pressure (high or normal), a logistic model is used:</p>

<p>[
\text{logit} P(y_i = 1) = \alpha_0 + \alphaâ€™X_i + \betaâ€™G_i
]</p>

<p>Here, ( P(y_i = 1) ) represents the probability of the ( i )-th subject having high blood pressure.</p>

<h3 id="skat-analysis">SKAT Analysis</h3>

<p>SKAT improves test power by assuming each ( \beta_j ) follows an arbitrary distribution with mean zero and variance ( w_j\tau ), where ( \tau ) is a variance component and ( w_j ) is a pre-specified weight for variant ( j ).</p>

<p>The SKAT model tests whether the gene variants influence the phenotype, adjusting for covariates, corresponding to the null hypothesis ( H_0: \beta = 0 ).</p>

<h3 id="example-calculation">Example Calculation</h3>

<p>Given a matrix ( G ) of genotypes and a diagonal matrix ( W ) of weights, we compute the kernel matrix ( K ) as follows:</p>

<p>[
K = GWGâ€™
]</p>

<p>where ( K(G_i, G_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{p} w_k G_{ik} G_{jk} ) measures the genetic similarity between subjects based on their genotypes adjusted by variant weights.</p>

<p>This analytical framework allows for a robust examination of the influences of multiple genetic variants on diseases such as high blood pressure, providing insights that are crucial for advancing personalized  medicine.</p>
