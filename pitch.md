**Quant is the critical layer that makes genomics work: interpretable, actionable, and accountable.**  

*Technically sound. Incredibly simple.*

---

**Company name:**
*SwitzerlandOmics GmbH* (in formation)

**Website:**
[SwitzerlandOmics.ch](https://switzerlandomics.ch)

**Founders:**
12 years of PhD-level experience in applied genomics and statistical modelling.
Backed by federal funding, national-scale clinical studies, and a proven track record of delivering complex projects on time and on budget-including six years of development across UZH, EPFL, and ETH Zurich.

**Stage:** Pre-incorporation

**Grant requested:** CHF 10,000 for company registration and secure data hosting.

## 🧭 The gap

**Genomics has extraordinary promise—but it remains underused.**
From patient diagnosis to drug development, medical decisions depend on understanding how genetic variants cause disease. Sequencing is fast and affordable. But one thing is still missing:

> A systematic, probability-based framework to interpret genetic variants—across all genes, inheritance modes, and evidence types.

Despite over a century of theoretical groundwork, this problem has never been solved. Until now.

## 🧬 Our Solution: Quant

**Quant is a statistical engine and product suite that delivers calibrated, genome-wide probabilities of disease causality.**
It includes three interoperable components:

* **Quant database** - pre-computed, licensable genome-wide priors.
* **Quant scan** - applies priors to real-world variant data for case interpretation.
* **Quant calc** - licensable algorithms to perform full probabilistic inference on new datasets.

Key capabilities:

* Priors tailored for autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked models.
* Integration of allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, ClinVar classifications, and uncertainty.
* Outputs **credible intervals** and variant-/gene-level disease probabilities.
* Validated on national-level cohorts across immune and rare disease genetics.

---

## 🧱 Product maturity

* **6 years of development** at UZH, EPFL, ETH Zurich
* **Peer-reviewed publications** and real-world validation
* Tools ready for use: **Quant database**  **Quant scan**, **Quant calc**, **PanelAppRex AI**, **QV database**

<!-- ## A century-old challenge, a modern solution -->

<!-- **Analogy:** -->
<!-- In the early 1900s, Sam Zemurray revolutionized the banana industry by seeing value where others saw waste—selling ripe bananas locally when everyone else focused on unripe fruit for long distances. He solved a logistics problem and changed an industry. -->

<!-- **The Problem (in simple terms):** -->
<!-- Today, genomics faces its own century-old challenge: despite incredible advances in DNA sequencing, we still struggle to reliably interpret what genetic variations mean for health, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. -->

<!-- **The Solution (in simple terms):** -->
<!-- Quant is our answer. It transforms complex genetic data into clear, probabilistic insights. Just as Zemurray turned overlooked bananas into a market advantage, Quant turns genetic uncertainty into actionable knowledge. -->

<!-- **The Scientific Side:** -->
<!-- Built on rigorous Bayesian statistics, population genetics, and years of real-world testing, Quant provides a systematic, probability-based framework for interpreting genetic variants. -->
