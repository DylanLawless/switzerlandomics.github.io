## üß≠ The gap

Genomic sequencing is fast and affordable. But interpretation remains the bottleneck.

Clinical and pharmaceutical decisions depend on variant interpretation - yet current methods are fragmented, uncertain, and incomplete.

> This is a 100-year-old problem requiring data and algorithms. Despite decades of theory, no complete solution existed until now.

---

## üß¨ Our solution
Quant (<a href="/technologies/quant/">product page</a>)
is the first calibrated, genome-wide framework that turns raw variant evidence into interpretable, probabilistic Bayesian conclusions.
It is a statistical engine and product suite.
It consists of three interoperable tools:

- **Quant database**: pre-computed genome-wide priors.  
- **Quant scan**: prepares and structures customer input.  
- **Quant calc**: performs probabilistic inference and outputs credible intervals.

Capabilities:

- Genome and variant-level confidence outputs with full uncertainty accounting.  
- Tailored priors for dominant, recessive, and X-linked models in disease.  
- Integration of trusted databases including allele frequencies and clincal genetics.  
- Validated on national-scale disease datasets.

---

## üìà Vision  
Quant brings a generational shift in how genetic variation is understood.
* Our long-term goal is to license Quant across diagnostics, drug pipelines, and commercial genomics.  
* A free tier is popularising our work through open-source, academically licensed software and datasets.  
* We continue to build complementary products, including **PanelAppRex AI** (curated gene panels), **Dante** (AI-assisted clinical reporting), and related public/private databases to support scalable growth.

---

## üìç Traction  
- Used in national rare disease diagnostics (Switzerland).
- Users of our documentation, codebase, and datasets.
- 2000+ online users.
- 300+ database users (i.e. downloads suitable for professionals).

---

## üß± Product maturity

- 6 years of development at UZH, EPFL, ETH Zurich.  
- Peer-reviewed publications and cohort-scale validation.  
- Ready-to-use tools: **Quant db**, **Quant scan**, **Quant calc**, **QV database**, **PanelAppRex AI**.
