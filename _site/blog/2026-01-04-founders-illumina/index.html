<p>How Illumina transformed DNA sequencing from specialist research into global genomic infrastructure through platform engineering and commercial scaling.</p>

<p>By the late 1990s, DNA sequencing remained slow and expensive. Sanger sequencing powered early genome projects but was impractical for population-scale studies. Sequencing a human genome required years and massive budgets, limiting genomics to elite research centres.</p>

<p>Illumina began in 1998 not as a sequencing company, but as a microarray and genotyping firm commercialising bead-based array technology developed at Tufts University. The founding team included David Walt, Larry Bock, John Stuelpnagel, Anthony Czarnik, and Mark Chee. Early systems enabled large-scale SNP genotyping and gene expression studies, helping laboratories process genetic variation more efficiently, but sequencing itself remained constrained.</p>

<p>Illumina leadership recognised microarrays would plateau, and sequencing was the long-term platform.</p>

<p>The decisive shift came from outside the company. In the mid-1990s, Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman at the University of Cambridge developed ideas that became sequencing by synthesis (SBS), based on reversible terminator chemistry and massively parallel short-read sequencing. Their company Solexa later commercialised this technology, demonstrating throughput far beyond previous methods and laying the foundation for modern large-scale genome sequencing.</p>

<p>At the time, multiple groups were attempting to replace Sanger sequencing through what became known as next-generation sequencing. Companies such as 454 Life Sciences, SOLiD, Ion Torrent, and Helicos introduced alternative approaches, but many struggled with scaling cost, throughput, or reliability. Over the following decade most competing platforms were discontinued or remained niche, while SBS platforms scaled economically and became the industry standard.</p>

<p>This industry acceleration was partly driven by public funding programmes, including initiatives in the United States aimed at achieving the long-sought goal of sequencing a human genome for roughly USD 1,000, which stimulated rapid investment and competition across sequencing technologies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Side note: This work emerged while both the public Human Genome Project, which used clone-by-clone sequencing, and Craig Venter’s Celera programme, which used whole-genome shotgun assembly, still relied on Sanger sequencing chemistry. SBS therefore represented a true technological break, replacing the earlier Sanger-based paradigm with massively parallel sequencing that enabled modern genome-scale throughput.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illumina acquired Solexa in January 2007 for roughly USD 650 million. This acquisition transformed the company from a microarray supplier into the dominant next-generation sequencing platform provider. Illumina then solved the harder problem: turning laboratory chemistry into reliable global infrastructure.</p>

<p>A critical element was the use of dense DNA cluster generation on flow cells, allowing millions of fragments to be sequenced simultaneously with strong signal detection while keeping optical and hardware costs manageable, enabling practical large-scale deployment.</p>

<p>After acquisition, Illumina rapidly expanded throughput. Under CEO Jay Flatley, the company turned the early Solexa systems into a scaled platform business with repeatable manufacturing, service, and consumables supply. Systems such as HiSeq, MiSeq, and NextSeq enabled sequencing to move from national genome centres into ordinary research and clinical laboratories. The 2014 HiSeq X Ten platform enabled sequencing of human genomes near the USD 1,000 threshold, a symbolic milestone that triggered population genomics projects worldwide.</p>

<p>Subsequent systems, particularly the NovaSeq platforms introduced from 2017 onward, further increased throughput and reduced per-genome cost, allowing sequencing to expand from national genome projects into routine large cohort and clinical programmes.</p>

<p>Adoption spread pragmatically. Pharmaceutical companies used sequencing for drug discovery. Hospitals adopted it for rare disease diagnosis and oncology profiling. Public health agencies used sequencing for pathogen tracking, including during pandemic responses. Sequencing shifted from specialist science to operational infrastructure.</p>

<p>Illumina’s commercial success relied less on instrument margins and more on consumables. Laboratories purchased sequencers once, then continuously bought reagents and flow cells, creating recurring revenue streams. Workflow compatibility and informatics integration reinforced ecosystem lock-in.</p>

<p>Over time, sequencing output grew faster than Moore’s law. By the mid-2010s, Illumina instruments produced the overwhelming majority of global sequencing data. Modern genomics research, cancer genomics, and many clinical pipelines now depend on this infrastructure.</p>

<p>Competing platforms often struggled to maintain cost reductions or operational simplicity at increasing scale, whereas incremental improvements in SBS chemistry and hardware allowed sequencing costs to continue falling while maintaining reliability.</p>

<p>Later years introduced new challenges, including competition, market saturation in research sequencing, and strategic expansion attempts outside core infrastructure. However, the enduring contribution remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The lasting lesson is that Illumina’s success did not come from inventing sequencing chemistry alone, but from operationalising it. Turning laboratory methods into robust global infrastructure removed the sequencing bottleneck and enabled modern genomics. The longer lesson is that success depended not only on scientific invention but on sustained engineering, manufacturing, and economic scaling that allowed sequencing to move from research experiments into routine global infrastructure.</p>
