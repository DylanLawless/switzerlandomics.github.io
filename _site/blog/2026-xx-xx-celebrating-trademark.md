## Celebrating Switzerland Omics trade mark registration

The *Switzerland Omics* word mark has been published and certified in the Swiss trade mark register, Swissreg, following examination by the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property (IGE).

In Switzerland, trade marks are examined and registered by the IGE ([read more](https://www.ige.ch/en/)), the federal authority responsible for intellectual property. Once examined, applications are published in Swissreg, the official public register that defines the scope and status of Swiss trade marks ([read more](https://www.swissreg.ch/database-client/home)). The IGE and Swissreg provide the legal framework and public record for trade mark protection in Switzerland.

Swiss trade mark applications are filed for defined goods and services using the Nice Classification, an internationally standardised system that ensures consistent classification across jurisdictions ([read more](https://www.wipo.int/en/web/classification-nice)).

Switzerland Omics develops and licenses expert software and curated scientific databases for professionals working in bioinformatics, genomics, and statistical research. Our systems support scientific data processing and statistical modelling and are provided as licensed software and web-based platforms. All core software and datasets are developed and maintained in-house.

Switzerland Omics also operates Genomic Vault, a custody platform for genomic and related scientific data. Genomic Vault provides long-term electronic data storage and controlled access, with full audit logging, while remaining independent from analytical or interpretative services.

The publication and certification of the Switzerland Omics trade mark establishes formal protection of the name under Swiss law and provides a clear legal basis for its use in connection with our software, databases, and data infrastructure.
