OMG WTF I love this industry, the fun never stops, Illumina just bought PacBio's "Onso" short read (SR) tech 🤯🤯🤯

For those mentally healthy people not paying close attention, here's the crazy Illumina/PacBio storyline:

😳 In 2018 long read (LR) sequencing was the next big thing so Illumina bought LR leader PacBio for $1B. But the FTC blocked it.
😳 By 2021 PacBio works out that LR is NOT in fact going to be the next big thing so buys an SR company for $1B. Alas that SR sequencer (Onso) flops.
😳 Illumina buys Onso SR technology for $50M.

Question of the day: why would Illumina buy the Onso IP? Why take on these really bad antitrust optics ("SR monopolist makes buy to add to SR monopoly")?

Here's my 🤪🤪🤪 theory:
- Illumina's SBS tech has Q30 read accuracy
- Roche (incoming) SBX tech has Q40 read accuracy
- PacBio (now Illumina) SBB tech has Q40 read accuracy

Hmm, feels a little jumpy 🤔🤔🤔
