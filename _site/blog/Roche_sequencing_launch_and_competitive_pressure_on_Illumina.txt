Roche sequencing launch and competitive pressure on Illumina

**Converted text:**

Well, any doubt about Roche going right at Illumina has been removed; yesterday Matt Sause (Diagnostics CEO) called their NGS sales goal as >$1.2B. One way to think about that is Roche thinks it can steal away 20% of Illumina's 90% market share 😱😱😱

"I really want to emphasize that 2026 is the year that we will launch our AXELIOS Sequencing Solution. This is a groundbreaking high-throughput solution that will deliver high accuracy, high throughput and flexible sequencing based on our proprietary SBX technology...this represents a potential blockbuster opportunity for us with SALES POTENTIAL ABOVE THE CHF 1 BILLION range."

"On May 12 we will have our Diagnostic Day as a live event in London we will take you through the entire portfolio and highlight this year will be SBX sequencing. As we are now in the global launch phase, I think there is the next steps to come with pricing and so on. So I think it will be an exciting event."

Personally I think the May 12th comment is a bit of a red herring. I'm pretty sure the long-awaited SBX consumables pricing will be announced in a couple of weeks at AGBT 🍿🍿🍿
