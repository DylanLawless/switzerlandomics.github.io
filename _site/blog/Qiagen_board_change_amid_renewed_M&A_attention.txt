Qiagen board change amid renewed M&A attention

**Converted text:**

Hmm, ex-COO of Thermo Fisher Scientific joins the QIAGEN board just as Qiagen goes into play as an M&A target. Well golly gosh 🤔🤔🤔

We are excited to welcome Mark Stevenson as a new member of our Supervisory Board as of January 23, 2026.

Mark Stevenson has more than 30 years of experience in life sciences technology companies, with a strong focus on operational execution and global scale. He is a former Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Thermo Fisher Scientific and currently serves as an Operating Partner at Fivespan Partners.

As Stephen H. Rusckowski, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, shared:
“Mark brings deep operational leadership and global life sciences experience at scale. His background will further strengthen the Supervisory Board’s ability to provide effective oversight and support disciplined capital allocation.”

Additionally, Prof. Dr. Ross Levine has stepped down from the Supervisory Board following his appointment to a new leadership role as Chief Scientific Officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. He will continue to serve as Chair of the QIAGEN Scientific Advisory Board.

Following these changes, the Supervisory Board will continue its work with the updated membership.
