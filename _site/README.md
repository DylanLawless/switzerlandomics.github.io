# This is the data for swisspedhealth
[swisspedhealth.ch](https://swisspedhealth.ch) hosted via [swisspedhealth.github.io](https://swisspedhealth.github.io)

Some installs may be required to serve this site locally for testing; 
e.g. at least requires:
"gem install jekyll-scholar"

The repo is transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site and then pushed to GitHub.
Jekyll serve runs this site locally for testing and building before pushing 
(jek.sh and rake commit_deploy). 
This site is built from writings in Markdown and rendered as a 
minimalist source for the swisspedhealth project, without popups, ads, or heavy content. 

The data is stored on GitHub and in private backups so that content is not 
lost and can be pushed from many locations.

Bibliography is set to update from my cloud master bib via shell script "update_bib.sh".
The scholar plugin is used by: plugins/ext.rb (require 'jekyll/scholar').
With this plugin, no information is required for the biblio in individual file headers.
Within text citations are used with: {% cite name %}.
The biblio is printed at end of file with:
{% bibliography --cited %}.

# Rake deploy pre-build before hosting
Plugins (scholar) cannot be run on GitHub pages, therefore the site is run by using the \_site directory as the root as described by [davidensinger.com](http://davidensinger.com/2013/07/automating-jekyll-deployment-to-github-pages-with-rake/).

To allow this to work, two branches are created:
* _source_
* _master_

Normally, GH pages looks for the _master_ branch. 
It will build the website project from the \_root directory and compile the website itself in safe-mode.
It would create its own version of the \_site subdirectory, as is produced when you run Jekyll locally.

Since we run plugins that GH pages does not use (scholar citations), the build would fail.
All writing is done from the _source_ branch. 
This contains the complete website data.
This branch is compiled by Jekyll locally and the resulting output is in \_site.

Then on the _master_ branch, we force the \_site subdirectory to act as the project root.
GH pages will host the pre-compiled site for us. 
If we no longer want this and prefer GH-pages to compile, 
we can go back to a single branch converting _source_ to be _master_.

**Normal version**
* branch _master_ 
	- \_root &rarr; GH pages build &rarr; host site.
	- \_site &rarr; ignored by GH pages.

**Modified version**
* branch _source_ 
	- \_root &rarr; jekyll local build &rarr; \_site.
* branch _master_
	- \_site &rarr; GH pages no build &rarr; host site.

**Protocol**

The Rakefile contains the final version of this description.
The steps are outlined here for clarity.
For the inital set up, we must create the source branch:
```
git branch -a
git checkout -b source
```

The following tasks are then automated by putting them in a rake file.
Delete master branch:
```
git branch -D master
```
Check out a new master branch:
```
git checkout -b master
```
Force the \_site subdirectory to be project root:
```
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter _site/ -f
```
Checkout the source branch:
```
git checkout source
```
Push all branches to origin:
```
git push --all origin
```

**Rakefile**

The rake file is used as follows:

List the tasks from the Rakefile
```
rake -T
```

Run these individually
```
rake preview
```

The normal protocol is to run the tasks in order with one command
```
rake commit_deploy
```

Make sure that `sh jek.sh` is run so that jekyll compiles the site and populates
\_site before commiting and pushing the _master_ to the live site.

# Cloning and keys
Since I work with others and use different accounts, machines, emails, here are some notes incase you or I need them.

To push to multiple github accounts with different keys,
and different machines, these settings can be used.
Instead of a global git config, local configs are used for each repo.
Here is the example with two of my repos.
The custom usernames for the local repo is shown (but custom email is removed to prevent spam).
[Create your ssh keys as per github recommendation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). 
In the .ssh directory, the config file will assign the key to each git repository that you clone based on the Host that you use. i.e. custom instead of the default:

* git clone git@custom.github.com:accout/repo.git
* git clone git@github.com:accout/repo.git

``` bash 
# Set up the ssh config file
cd ~/.ssh/config

# set such that Host and User are custom
# swisspedhealth repo
Host swisspedhealth.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User swisspedhealth
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key1_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

# differentwebpage repo
Host differentwebpage.github.com
  HostName github.com
  User someusername
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/key2_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes

```

Then clone your repo using the custom Host instead of the default provided by github when you use button "clone/ssh/copy".

``` bash
# Clone using the correct Host as per config.
# As shown at the end of this page, you may need to clone with submodules.
# You can do by add the "--recursive" flag. 
git clone --recursive git@swisspedhealth.github.com:swisspedhealth/swisspedhealth.github.io.git

# Set the local user here (instead of global, i.e. /Users/user/.gitconfig)
cd "the clone repo dir"
git config user.email personemail@addess.com
git config user.name swisspedhealth

# Clone using the correct Host as per config
git clone git@swisspedhealth.github.com:swisspedhealth/swisspedhealth.github.io.git

cd "the clone repo dir"
git config user.email someotheremail@address.com
git config user.name someotherusername
```

You should now be able to pull and push from that repo without the ["incorrect user" problems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4665337/git-pushing-to-remote-github-repository-as-wrong-user).

## Multiple branches
Since the website is built and deploy with source and master, you will need both and switch to source for building.

`git pull --all`

`git branch -a`

`git checkout source`

# Submodules
I have a fork of jekyll-reading-time as a submodule in plugins.
If you did not have this submodule added in \_plugins (with reading_time_filter.rb), then the  options set in \_layouts/topics.html and post.html would cause content to be printed 2 times, with a formatting error due to the jekyll-reading-time command "{{ content | reading_time }}".
To add a submodule, e.g. git within the git such as in bundles, use

git submodule add https://github.com/...

## Clone submodule default
To clone use a submodule:

`git clone --recursive git://github.com/foo/bar.git`
or if you forgot or cant use recursive, do

`git submodule init` and  `git submodule update`

## Clone submodule with custom host and user SSH
And if you are using the ssh method shown above you will need to define the path such that git can make the correct request to match your .ssh/config:

To be able to clone the submodule (e.g. \_plugins/jekyll-reading-time), 
modify the .gitmodules url

From:	`url = git@github.com:swisspedhealth/jekyll-reading-time.git`

To:		`url = git@swisspedhealth.github.com:swisspedhealth/jekyll-reading-time.git`

Set git to use the updated .gitmodules:

`git submodule sync`

Then update the submodules

`git submodule init`

`git submodule update`

# bfg and lfs
We do not aim to have large data files on this website. 
However, sometimes they are used in projects and might be added to the repo.
To prune out large files that are not required in the git history, bfg was used. 
This is not common, but to keep the repo size small files that are not required in the git history, bfg was used. 
This is not common but required to keep the repo size small.
The jar of bfg was used as follows:

`java -jar ~/Downloads/bfg-1.14.0.jar --no-blob-protection --strip-blobs-bigger-than 60M ~/web/swisspedhealth.github.io/`

`git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive`

# rbenv
Running a consistent ruby environment. 
<https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv>
`brew install rbenv`

After install, init, and adding `~/.bash_profile` variable:
` export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH" `
` eval "$(rbenv init -)" `

use the version specificied by the gemfile, e.g.
`rbenv install 2.7.0`

It is critical to also set:
`rbenv local 2.7.0`
`rbenv global 2.7.0`

to allow the final bundle install to work:
`gem install bundler`
`bundle install`

Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)
