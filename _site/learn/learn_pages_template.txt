# learn pages template

Design and writing standard for `/learn/`

This document defines the required structure, tone, and level of technical detail for SwitzerlandOmics learn pages.

Learn pages are short, authoritative reference entries for working scientists. They must be accurate, readable, and useful in practice.

They are not vendor documentation, tutorials, or marketing pages.

---

## Non-negotiables

### Layout ownership

The `learn` layout renders the page title and description.

Rules:

- Do not include an H1 (`# ...`) inside the page body.
- Do not repeat the title or description in the first lines.
- Start immediately with the definition paragraph.

Correct:

```markdown
A VCF file is a tab-delimited format that records variant sites and per-sample genotypes.
````

Incorrect:

```markdown
# What is a VCF file?
A VCF file is...
```

### One page, one question

Each page answers one search intent clearly.

Good titles:

* `What is X?`
* `X explained`
* `X vs Y`

Avoid titles that combine topics unless the intent is explicitly comparative.

### Accuracy over completeness

Include detail that prevents real interpretation errors. Do not copy the full specification.

If a detail is important but rare, acknowledge it briefly and link to the authoritative source.

---

## Voice and style rules

Write like a senior practitioner speaking to another senior practitioner.

* Neutral and direct.
* Short sentences.
* No filler, no jokes, no storytelling.
* No vendor framing.
* No marketing language.

Avoid:

* “Let’s explore…”
* “In this article…”
* “You have been warned…”
* “Best in class…”

Prefer:

* “VCF records…”
* “This matters because…”
* “Common mistake: …”

---

## Technical detail policy

A learn page is successful if a reader can:

1. Define the concept.
2. Place it in a workflow.
3. Interpret a real example correctly.
4. Avoid the most common mistakes.
5. Find the specification or deeper reference.

Include:

* The minimal set of definitions needed for correct use.
* The most common pitfalls.
* One worked example when interpretation is non-trivial.

Exclude:

* Long dumps of headers, logs, or full spec sections.
* Tool command lines unless the page is explicitly about a tool.
* Caller-specific defaults unless labelled as such.

Rule of thumb:

* If omission causes wrong conclusions, include it.
* If omission only prevents advanced optimisation, link out.

---

## Length and density

Default target: **600 to 1,200 words**.

Shorter is acceptable for simple concepts.
Longer is acceptable for formats where missing detail causes frequent mistakes.

Use tables and code blocks to reduce reading time, not to add bulk.

---

## Required page front matter

Every page must begin with:

```yaml
---
title: ...
layout: learn
description: ...
weight: 1
category: ...
---
```

`title` and `description` are user-facing and must be plain and specific.

---

## Standard page structure

Use the following structure unless the topic type requires a variant (see below).

### 1. Definition

A single paragraph that answers the title question directly.
It must stand alone as a snippet.

Example:

```markdown
A BAM file is a binary, indexed representation of aligned sequencing reads, used for fast random access to alignments.
```

### 2. Why it exists

Two to five sentences explaining the practical purpose.

### 3. Core structure or mechanism

Explain the minimum internal structure needed to interpret the thing correctly.

Use a short table if it reduces effort.

### 4. Example

Include one example when the reader needs to learn how to read real data.

Rules for examples:

* Keep them small.
* Annotate only what matters.
* Prefer one example over many.

### 5. Details that matter

Bullet list of the highest-impact details that commonly break pipelines or interpretation.

### 6. Common mistakes

List the mistakes readers actually make.
Make each mistake concrete.

### 7. Where it fits in pipelines

Provide a one-line workflow arrow.

### 8. Adjacent concept

Explain one close neighbour (example: VCF vs gVCF).
Keep it short.

### 9. References

Link to one authoritative specification or canonical reference.
Use proper markdown links if they are going to be included. 

Do not copy the spec.

---

## Topic-specific minimum requirements

### File format pages (VCF, BAM, CRAM, FASTQ)

Must include:

* Minimal file structure.
* One example record with interpretation.
* The fields that cause common mistakes.
* Operational note if compression or indexing is standard.
* Link to the spec.

Do not include:

* Full header dumps.
* Tool tutorials.

### Concept pages (phasing, depth, allele frequency)

Must include:

* Definition.
* One “why it matters” consequence.
* One concrete example.
* Common confusion points.

### Pipeline step pages (alignment, variant calling, joint genotyping)

Must include:

* Inputs and outputs.
* Where it sits in the pipeline.
* One common failure mode.
* Links to deeper docs.

---

## Tables and code blocks

Tables must earn their space.

Rules:

* Keep tables narrow.
* Use tables for field meanings and comparisons.
* Avoid long, scrolling tables.

Code blocks:

* Use for short examples only.
* No leading or trailing blank lines inside fences.
* Prefer one block with comments over multiple blocks.

Good:

```text
#CHROM POS REF ALT FORMAT SAMPLE1
20 10001617 C A GT:DP 0/1:38
```

Bad:

* Multiple screens of output.
* Raw header dumps.

---

## What not to do

Do not:

* Clone vendor documentation.
* Reproduce specifications verbatim.
* Use tutorial voice or step-by-step walkthroughs.
* Add a “product section” by default.
* Add claims about being “best” or “leading”.

If you need to mention SwitzerlandOmics:

* Keep it structural and optional.
* One sentence maximum.
* Only if it helps the reader place the concept in a real workflow.

---

## Quality checklist

Before publishing, confirm:

* No H1 in the body.
* First paragraph is a definition and stands alone.
* A reader can interpret at least one real example.
* The highest-impact pitfalls are covered.
* No vendor framing, no marketing language.
* One authoritative reference is linked.
* The page reads as calm, precise, and practical.

Final test:

Would a senior bioinformatician accept this as technically correct without wanting to rewrite it?

If not, revise.

Remember to:

First start by strategising about the content completely. 
Then review that plan. 
Then finally write up the new content for the page based on the plan. 
lastly start the output with a filename with underscore separators to copy paste such as `file_is_called.md`.
