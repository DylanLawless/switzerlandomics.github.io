## Security and regulatory oversight

The role is active pre-incorporation and will be formally introduced at a later stage.

This role is responsible for security architecture, auditability, and regulatory interpretation across data custody, access control, and evidence traceability. Oversight focuses on ensuring that verification, logging, and compliance requirements are designed as first-order constraints rather than post-hoc controls.
