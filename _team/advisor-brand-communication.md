## Brand and communication governance

The advisor is engaged pre-incorporation and will be formally introduced at a later stage.

This advisor oversees brand, language, and external communication to ensure that public representation remains precise, restrained, and consistent with the underlying system design. The role focuses on preventing interpretive drift between technical architecture and public messaging, particularly in regulated and institutional contexts.
