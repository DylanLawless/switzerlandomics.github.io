## Founder and chief architect

Dylan is a computational biologist and full stack systems architect working at the interface of genomics, healthcare, and infrastructure. His work has been carried out across leading academic and clinical environments including the University of Zurich, the University Children’s Hospital Zurich, and EPFL, spanning experimental disease discovery, statistical genomics, and the design of regulated analysis platforms. This background informs his focus on building genomic systems that remain valid from data generation through interpretation and long-term operation. Dylan founded Switzerland Omics to translate peer-reviewed genomics into auditable, production-grade infrastructure used across research, healthcare, and industry, including probabilistic interpretation frameworks and Genomic Vault, a secure genome custody platform. His work centres on making genomic evidence measurable, accountable, and reusable at scale.
