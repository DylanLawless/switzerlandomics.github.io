* Ask for names: Ask for the names of your primary hospital doctor, nurses who are assigned to your room, as well as specialists who make up your healthcare team.
* Speak with your physician about your diagnosis: Ask for your main diagnosis, other potential issues, and express any concerns or questions that you may have.
* Ask how your illnesses or post-operative health is responding to treatment or the procedure: Ask your nursing staff about your progress, as well as what you can do to assist in the recovery process.
* Ask for assistance from trusted family members and friends: Ask your family, friends, or other trusted acquaintances to be involved and help in your recovery.  Your loved ones can be an important part of your recovery, so it is important to ask those you trust most for help.
* Speak to a hospital social worker: If you have questions about insurance and billing, ask to speak with a hospital social worker who can help clarify what your insurance covers and how much you may be required to pay after your hospital stay.
* Speak with your nurse manager or charge nurse if you are having issues with care or communication: Your nurse should keep you informed and updated on your treatment, prognosis, and recovery. If you have questions or concerns, ask to speak with the manager or charge nurse for clarification.
* Prior to discharge, find out what medications you should continue to take: Before leaving the hospital, take the time to fully review what medications you will be taking, what you should hold off on taking, and how these medications may affect you. A patient hospital checklist is a great way to get started documenting your medications, and can easily be updated once you are home and some medications may be tapered off.
* Ask the medical staff to demonstrate to you and your caregivers any treatments that you may need after discharge: If your treatment plan requires at-home involvement from you or a caregiver, make sure that you have all the information needed.  For example, if you require at-home injections, your doctor or nurse should show you how to administer the injection, and what warning signs to look for that something went wrong.  If your treatment requires bandages or dressings, your healthcare team should show you how to change the bandage properly. Your doctor or nurse should also counsel you on how to prevent infection. Before you leave the hospital, you should practice in front of a doctor or nurse so that you know you are doing it correctly.
* Find out if it is safe to perform ordinary, daily tasks on your own: Before leaving the hospital, find out if you are healthy enough to resume daily tasks like driving, taking a shower, or exercising.  Never assume that because you have been discharged that you are ready to resume normal activities. Many illnesses and injuries take time to heal, and many medications can cause side effects you might not consider.
* Determine whether or not you can or should use medical equipment to aid in recovery: Speak with your nurse or doctor about any equipment that may be able to assist you during the recovery process, such as a heart rate monitor, walker, or brace.
* Ask about follow-up appointments: Ask your healthcare team if you will need a follow up appointment, further treatments, or additional testing. Make note of any important dates in your calendar.
* Let your medical staff know if you have any questions about your discharge instructions: Read through any discharge instructions before leaving the hospital and make sure you understand everything covered in the instructions.
