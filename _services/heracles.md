Heracles is a state-of-the-art genomics analysis tool that generates clinical-grade genomic reports from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data. 

We have a range of tools that automate the transformation of raw genomic data into comprehensive interpretation evidence. 
This technical data is digested by Heracles into **structured reports** that support clinical decisions or summarise the key research outcome.

Our structured reports adhere to rigorous ACMG guidelines, ensuring **accuracy** and **reliability**.
Each report is crafted to support decisions and summarise research outcomes, providing detailed insights from genetic variant identification to complex interpretation stages using standardised nomenclature like HGVS and reference genomes.

Key features of Heracles include **automated report generation** in PDF and HTML formats, **customisable** input parameters for tailored analysis, and **integrated data visualisation** tools such as PCA plots and evidence metrics. 
A **unique aspect** of our approach is the inclusion of a quantifiable **confidence score** with each report, offering clinicians and researchers a clear measure of certainty in the results, essential for disease diagnosis and genomic research.
Heracles reports are comprehensive, expertly curated, and fully compliant with international standards, making them easily interpretable by global healthcare professionals. 

Users can **act upon the insights** provided because each result is presented with a confidence range, indicating how much is known and explaining the uncertainties associated with the findings. This **clarity** provides stakeholders with an **informed decision** based on the degree of certainty in the genetic analysis.
