## Streamline genetic diagnosis of IEI 
to quantify both known and uncertain evidence into a single, evidence-based conclusion

![WGS analysis](/images/services/var_risk_est_iei_genetics.png)

## What we offer

* **Pre-calculated variant probabilities**
  * Prior probabilities for 54 814 ClinVar variants across 557 IEI genes
  * Integrates population allele frequencies, ClinVar classifications and Hardy-Weinberg expectations under AD, AR and X-linked models
  * Available as flat files with TSV, Rds and HTML interface

* **Gene summary datasets**
  * Per-gene summaries of pathogenic burden and inheritance mode distribution
  * Aligned to IUIS classification and ACMG guidelines
  * Ready for direct import into your analysis pipelines

## What you can do

* **Evidence-aware diagnosis**
  * Combine observed and unobserved variants in a Bayesian framework
  * Generate posterior probabilities with credible intervals for each candidate gene or variant
  * Distinguish supported, plausible-but-unseen and excluded findings

* **Streamlined reporting**
  * Produce structured, confidence-ranked reports for clinicians or end users
  * Accelerate candidate gene ranking and manual review

* **Seamless integration**
  * Plug in datasets as a diagnostic engine into your bioinformat platform
  * Reduce manual curation, speed up turnaround and deliver a consistent, high-confidence product
