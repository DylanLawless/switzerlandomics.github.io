<!-- Quant delivers evidence-based probabilities for clear and confident genetic diagnoses -->


    
Quant is a statistical framework that transforms how we interpret genomic data by assigning calibrated, quantitative confidence to variant classification.
For over a century, statisticians and geneticists have sought to quantify the probability of genetic disease, but progress was limited by the absence of comprehensive data and a rigorous algorithmic framework.

Unlike traditional approaches that stop at binary calls of "pathogenic" or "benign," Quant measures every interpretation, integrating both observed variants and unobserved possibilities into a rigorous probabilistic model.
Built on foundations of population genetics, Hardy-Weinberg expectations, and Bayesian inference, it delivers formal genome-wide priors tailored to each inheritance model: autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked.
The system quantifies not only true positives, but also the probability of missed causal variants, enabling fully accountable and transparent conclusions.

We validated Quant using national cohorts, showing high concordance between predicted and observed case counts.
The resulting dataset offers a reliable foundation for clinical decisions and large-scale studies alike.
By structuring variant evidence in a way that can be read by both humans and machines, Quant lays the groundwork for relaible diagnosis and robust learning systems in AI-powered genomics.

This video presents the first implementation of the Quant base model, which was used here for diagnosing inborn errors of immunity (IEI).

**Technically sound. Incredibly simple. The missing element in genomic interpretation.**
