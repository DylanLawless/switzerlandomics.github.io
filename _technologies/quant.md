**The missing element in genomic interpretation.**  

---

For over a century, we have known how genetic variants should behave. But we have never had a system that measures, with statistical confidence, whether a given genome fits that expectation.

Traditional approaches stop at labels like *pathogenic*, *benign*, or *damaging*. These are useful shortcuts, but too limited for clinical, pharmacogenomic, or genome engineering.

Quant replaces labels with a probabilistic framework. It estimates how likely any variant, observed or not, explains a functional effect.

Built on Hardy-Weinberg theory, Bayesian inference, and population-scale priors, Quant turns variant interpretation into a reproducible, rigorous system.

## A complete inference system

- **Quant DB** provides genome-wide calibrated priors for every variant.
- **Quant Scan** extracts observed and unobserved variant evidence from each genome.
- **Quant Calc** integrates the data and computes the probability that any variant explains the disease, with a credible interval.

The result is a rigorous, interpretable framework for genomic inference across diagnostics, discovery, and design.

Validated in national studies. AI-ready format. Built for clinical labs, research pipelines, and real-world use.

<!-- Quant is a statistical framework that transforms how we interpret genomic data by assigning calibrated, quantitative confidence to variant classification. -->
<!-- For over a century, statisticians and geneticists have sought to quantify the probability of genetic disease, but progress was limited by the absence of comprehensive data and a rigorous algorithmic framework. -->

<!-- Unlike traditional approaches that stop at binary calls of "pathogenic" or "benign," Quant measures every interpretation, integrating both observed variants and unobserved possibilities into a rigorous probabilistic model. -->
<!-- Built on foundations of population genetics, Hardy-Weinberg expectations, and Bayesian inference, it delivers formal genome-wide priors tailored to each inheritance model: autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked. -->
<!-- The system quantifies not only true positives, but also the probability of missed causal variants, enabling fully accountable and transparent conclusions. -->


<!-- <!-1- We provide the **Quant Database** of credible intervals as an exact, quantitative measure of variant interpretation. -1-> -->
<!-- <!-1- The supporting algorithms, **Quant Scan** for extracting variant evidence and **Quant Calc** for computing disease probabilities, can be applied to new datasets or integrated into existing diagnostic pipelines. -1-> -->

<!-- We validated Quant using national cohorts, showing high concordance between predicted and observed case counts. -->
<!-- The resulting dataset offers a reliable foundation for clinical decisions and large-scale studies alike. -->
<!-- By structuring variant evidence in a way that can be read by both humans and machines, Quant lays the groundwork for relaible diagnosis and robust learning systems in AI-powered genomics. -->
