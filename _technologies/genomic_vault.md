## Why this exists

For decades, secure genome custody and controlled access were available only to specialised institutions.

Hospitals, national programmes, and large research centres could store genomes long-term, control access, and maintain complete audit trails. A normal, scientifically literate individual could not. Their data moved between providers, analyses, and reports without continuity or control.

Genomic Vault makes this custody model available to everyone.

The same control, access discipline, and accountability apply whether the customer is a private individual, a clinical group, or an expert institution managing a cohort.

## About Genomic Vault

Genomic Vault is a Swiss custody and access platform for genome data, created by Switzerland Omics. It preserves raw genome files and related outputs, keeps them private by default, and enables controlled sharing when required.

The service is designed for individuals and clinics who require long-term stewardship of genomic data without secondary use, resale, or embedded analysis.


---

## What it does

Genomic Vault provides long-term custody of each genome.

Access is granted only on explicit request, limited to defined data types, and recorded in a permanent audit trail. Data are preserved in formats used in precision medicine and bioinformatics so they remain usable as methods and applications evolve.

---

## What it does not do

Genomic Vault does not analyse genomes.  
It does not interpret results.  
It does not provide medical advice.  
It does not monetise or reuse data.

The platform exists to preserve and govern access, not to draw conclusions.

---

## Why custody matters

Genome sequencing can be repeated. Custody cannot.

Without consistent stewardship, genome data fragment across providers, pipelines, and reporting standards. Results become difficult to reconcile, audit, or reuse. Consent must be repeatedly renegotiated, and it becomes unclear what has been tested and what has not.

Genomic Vault provides a stable, expert-managed record that persists beyond any single analysis or provider.

---

## How access works

Access is handled through explicit, user-controlled requests.

Each request specifies the genome, the data type, and the named recipient, for example a clinician or laboratory. Requests are reviewed, fulfilled, and logged, creating a complete record of what was shared, with whom, and when.

This structure supports clinical governance without exposing data by default.

---

## Position in the field

Genomic Vault complements laboratories, clinics, and analysis providers rather than replacing them.

National and pharmaceutical initiatives operate at population scale. Genomic Vault protects the individual first, providing custody infrastructure that has historically been unavailable outside institutional settings.

It is parallel infrastructure, not a competing service.

---

## Pricing principle

Genomic Vault is a premium service.

The price reflects the real cost of long-term custodianship, expert governance, and independence from data monetisation. Value is derived from preserving integrity and availability over time, not from secondary use of data.

---

## Access

Genomic Vault is available directly to individuals and through selected clinical partners.

Account access and data requests are managed through the secure customer portal.

---

## Governance and compliance

Genomic Vault operates under Swiss law, including the Federal Act on Data Protection (revDSG). It is a custody and governance platform, not a diagnostic or medical device.

Detailed information on legal framework, data protection, security controls, regulatory positioning, and SPHN-compliant metadata is provided in the dedicated compliance section.
