---

SwissPedHealth was created because we firmly believe that every patient is unique. Therefore, our treatment approach should reflect this uniqueness. Our initiative is to provide personalised health care, which means tailoring treatments based on scientific evidence, using genomics, multi-omics, and other innovative forms of analysis. 

## Our Approach

Our personalised health care model revolves around the principle of using advanced diagnostics to understand the root cause of diseases, particularly in children with rare diseases. By harnessing cutting-edge scientific methods, we can detect the causes of illness with better precision. Our goal is not only to devise treatments that are unique to each patient but also to make new discoveries that could benefit all of society in the future.

## Multi-Omic Diagnosis 

A critical part of our personalised health care approach is the use of multi-omic diagnoses. This method involves examining the patient's genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to fully understand the disease. This detailed analysis allows us to identify and target the specific disease mechanisms in each patient, leading to treatments that are more effective and have fewer side effects.

## Involvement of Patients and the Public

We place major importance on the involvement of all patients, their families, and the public in our work. Openness and fairness are key requirements to build a productive and functional personalised health network. We believe that your involvement can help us deliver world-class treatments, today and into the future.

## Conclusion

Personalised health care is the future of medicine. We are committed to making this future a reality by using advanced scientific methods and prioritizing patient involvement. Together, we can revolutionize health care and improve the lives of our patients.
