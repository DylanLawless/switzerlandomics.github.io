notes:
  - 'gnomad: gnomAD flags are retained for review; presence of any flag requires explicit mention or justification in final causal report. For information see https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/help'
  - 'ACMG: ACMG benign evidence codes are retained for review; variants carrying these codes must be justified in the final causal interpretation report'
  - 'ACMG: For details on ACMG criteria see Richards et al. 2015, Li et al. 2017, Riggs et al. 2020, Tavtigian et al. 2020'
  - 'ACMG: Variants containing benign evidence codes (BA, BS, BP) are not excluded but must be explicitly reviewed in the final report'
  - 'PPIE: For each case, record whether patient or public representation requirements were met according to context (clinical, research, or commercial).'
  - 'PPIE: Minimum record includes: opportunity for expert consultation, whether discussion occurred, and whether non-actionable findings were addressed.'
  - 'PPIE: In commercial contexts, the report itself may satisfy this requirement if it conveys the relevant information clearly and accessibly without requiring direct consultation.'
  - 'PPIE: In research or cohort studies, record whether participants were informed about data use and whether individual feedback was planned.'
  - 'inheritance priority ordering applied downstream: compound_het > biallelic_hom > de_novo > possible_compound_het > single_het_parent > proband_geno'
  - compound_het includes inherited, inherited+de novo, and dual de novo in trans (phasing required downstream)
  - missing parent genotypes allow de_novo and possible_compound_het, and may still support compound_het depending on counts
  - 'genotype mapping applied upstream: 00=REF, 01=HET, 10=HET, 11=HOM'
  - 'RNA filter: transcript must be observed in at least one control sample to consider patient quantification reliable'
  - RNA FAIL indicates no expression in all controls, patient value should not be interpreted quantitatively
  - 'MAX_FREQ: High population frequency reduces plausibility for rare disease and requires explicit review.'
