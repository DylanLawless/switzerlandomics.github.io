title: Statistical analysis
---

Statistical analysis is critical to our research, allowing our researchers to analyze data and draw conclusions about the relationships between variables. 
In pediatric medicine, statistical methods are used in various ways, including rare disease diagnosis, precision medicine, diagnosis and treatment of known disorders, genetics, and pediatric health. 
Here are some examples of statistical methods and how we apply them for our medical research.

## Regression Analysis Techniques
Regression analysis techniques are used to examine the relationship between two variables. 
These techniques are used in pediatric medicine to identify risk factors for various conditions and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. 
Two types of regression analysis techniques are commonly used in medical research:

* Linear regression: Linear regression is used to determine the relationship between two continuous variables. For example, it can be used to determine if a child's age is related to their weight or height.
* Logistic regression: Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is categorical. It is commonly used in pediatric medicine to identify risk factors for diseases or conditions.

## Epidemiological Study Designs
Epidemiological study designs are used to examine the distribution and determinants of health and disease. 
These studies can help to identify risk factors for diseases and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. 
One type of epidemiological study design is: Case/control studies.
Case/control studies compare individuals with a particular condition or disease to those without the condition. They are commonly used to identify risk factors for rare diseases in pediatric medicine.

## Genomics Research Techniques
Genomics research techniques are used to study the genetic basis of diseases and to identify genetic variants associated with diseases. 
Several genomics research techniques are commonly used in medical research.
For example, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify genetic variants that are associated with diseases. 
In pediatric medicine, GWAS can be used to identify genetic risk factors for diseases that affect children.
GWAS are used to discover common causes of disease. 

Some genetic causes of illness may be rare and require a range of analysis methods. 
Gene burden testing may find mutle genetic determinants of disease in a gene that is common to many patients with the same condition.
Sequence kernel association testing is one type of statistical analysis used to identify associations between genetic variants and disease risk. 
With these types of analysis we may identify genetic risk factorsfor rare pediatric diseases.

While some causes of illness can be identified based on DNA sequencing, some outcomes can only be detected by analysis of patient RNA or proteomic data.
A mixture of routine diagnoisis and modern research-based investication aims to yield the best outcome for discovery and treatment. 

## Machine Learning Techniques
Machine learning techniques are used to identify patterns in large datasets and to make predictions based on these patterns. 
Machine learning is commonly used in pediatric medicine for precision medicine and diagnosis of diseases. 
One of our aims is to identify the likelihood a child developing a particular disease based on their genetic makeup and medical history, and provide intervention before they are affected. 

## Time-to-Event Analysis Techniques
Time-to-event analysis techniques are used to analyze the time it takes for an event to occur. 
These methods are commonly used in pediatric medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and to identify risk factors for diseases. 
We may analyze the time it takes for a particular event to occur, such as the onset of a disease. 
This can help us to identify risk factors for diseases and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments.

## Multivariate Analysis Techniques
Multivariate analysis techniques are used to analyze the relationships between multiple variables. 
These techniques are commonly used in pediatric medicine to identify risk factors for diseases and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. 
Two types of multivariate analysis commonly used in medical research are:
For example, ANOVA is used to compare means between multiple groups. 
It can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for pediatric diseases.
Bayesian analysis is used to estimate probabilities and to update these probabilities based on new data. It can be used in pediatric medicine to identify risk factors for diseases and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.

## Summary
Statistical analysis is an important tool used in many areas of medical research, including rare disease diagnosis, precision medicine, diagnosis and treatment of known disorders, genetics, and pediatric health. 
By identifying patterns and relationships in data, statistical analysis helps researchers make important discoveries that can improve patient care and outcomes.
