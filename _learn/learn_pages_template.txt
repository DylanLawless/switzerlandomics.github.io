First start by strategising about the content completely. 
Then review that plan. 
Then finally write up the new content for the page based on the plan. 
lastly start the output with a filename with underscore separators to copy paste such as `file_is_called.md`.


Here the **design guide must change**, not the page.
Your layout already renders:

• page title
• description

Therefore the **content must not repeat them**.

The guide must explicitly enforce:

* No H1 inside learn pages
* Content starts directly with definition
* Layout owns the title and description

Below is the **corrected design guide**, with duplication removed and rules made explicit.

```markdown
# Switzerland Omics learn pages  
## Design and writing guide

This document defines how pages under `/learn/` are structured, formatted, and written.

Learn pages provide short, reliable explanations of genomics and bioinformatics topics. They attract readers from search engines, provide rapid orientation, and establish Switzerland Omics as trusted infrastructure knowledge.

These pages are not documentation, tutorials, or product marketing.

Each page answers one question clearly, allows readers to understand where the concept fits, and then allows them to leave or continue into deeper material.

Target reading time: under one minute.

---

## Required file structure

All learn pages must live under:

```

/learn/

```

Each topic is a Markdown file:

```

/learn/file_name.md

```

Example:

```

/learn/what-is-a-vcf-file.md

```

URLs resolve as:

```

/learn/what-is-a-vcf-file/

````

File names must be lowercase and hyphen-separated.

---

## Required page metadata

Each learn page must start with front matter:

```yaml
---
title: What is a VCF file?
layout: learn
description: Short explanation of the Variant Call Format used in genomics
weight: 1
category: data-formats
---
````

### title

Displayed by layout and used for SEO.

### description

Displayed by layout and used for SEO previews.

### layout

Always:

```
layout: learn
```

### weight

Controls ordering on `/learn/` index pages.
set all weights to 1 since we will control the layout elsewhere. 

### category

Used for automatic grouping as the collection grows.

---

## Critical layout rule

The layout already renders:

• Page title
• Page description

Therefore:

✅ Learn pages **must not repeat the title**
✅ Learn pages **must not include an H1 heading**
✅ Content must start directly with explanation text

Incorrect:

```markdown
# What is a VCF file?
```

Correct:

```markdown
A VCF file stores genetic variants detected from sequencing data...
```

Title and description belong to layout, not content.

---

## Purpose of learn pages

Each learn page must:

• Answer a common genomics or bioinformatics search query
• Provide fast orientation, not deep instruction
• Be technically correct and neutral in tone
• Build trust through clarity and restraint
• Allow natural discovery of Switzerland Omics systems

Readers should leave thinking:

“I understand where this fits.”

---

## What learn pages are not

Learn pages must not be:

• Developer documentation
• Tutorials or step-by-step guides
• Academic reviews
• Marketing pages
• Product landing pages

Deep technical detail belongs in `/docs/`.

Learn pages exist for comprehension, not mastery.

---

## Core writing principles

### Clarity is authority

Short sentences and clear structure signal competence.

### Reveal structure, not claims

Explain how a system fits within workflows.

### Consequence over mechanics

Explain why something matters before explaining details.

### Calm authority

Avoid conversational teaching tone.

### Respect the reader

Assume intelligence and impatience. Remove filler.

---

## Page length and density

Target:

• 300 to 500 words
• Under one minute reading time
• Minimal tables or examples
• No deep technical digressions

Long explanations should link to documentation instead.

---

## Mandatory page structure

All learn pages must follow this structure.

---

### 1. Definition paragraph

The **first paragraph directly answers the search query**.

It should work as a Google featured snippet.

Example:

```
A VCF file stores genetic variants detected from sequencing data, together with genotype and quality information.
```

No introduction or storytelling.

---

### 2. Why it exists

Two or three sentences explaining purpose or consequence.

---

### 3. What it contains or how it works

Minimal internal structure only.

---

### 4. Where it fits in pipelines

Show workflow placement.

Example:

```
Sequencing → Alignment → Variant calling → VCF → Interpretation
```

---

### 5. Adjacent concept

Explain only the closest related concept.

Examples:

• VCF vs gVCF
• BAM vs CRAM

---

### 6. Relation to Switzerland Omics

Provide neutral system placement.

Correct:

“Switzerland Omics systems operate on variant data recorded in VCF files during evidence extraction and interpretation.”

Not promotional.

---

### 7. Link to deeper material

End with neutral reference to specifications or documentation.

---

## Writing tone guidelines

Correct tone:

• Neutral
• Calm
• Direct
• Technically precise

Avoid:

• Tutorial voice
• Conversational filler
• Marketing language

Bad:

“Let’s explore how VCF works.”

Good:

“VCF records variant positions detected from sequencing data.”

---

## Table and example usage

Tables must reduce cognitive load.

Rules:

• Maximum six rows
• Essential fields only
• No dense annotations

Examples illustrate orientation, not syntax teaching.

---

## SEO writing rules

Each page targets a clear search query.

Preferred titles:

```
What is X?
X explained
X vs Y explained
```

Rules:

• Natural keyword usage
• No stuffing
• Clarity over tricks

SEO success follows clarity.

---

## Product integration rule

Learn pages build trust first.

Product discovery must be structural, not promotional.

---

## Example page skeleton

```markdown
---
title: What is a VCF file?
layout: learn
description: Explanation of the Variant Call Format
weight: 1
category: data-formats
---

A VCF file stores genetic variants detected from sequencing data...

## Why VCF files exist

...

## What a VCF contains

...

## Where VCF appears in pipelines

...

## VCF and gVCF

...

## Relation to Switzerland Omics systems

...

## Technical specification

...
```

---

## Writing checklist before publishing

Confirm:

• No H1 in content
• Definition appears immediately
• Page readable in under one minute
• No tutorial tone
• No marketing language
• Workflow placement clear
• Adjacent concept included
• Product mention neutral

Final screening question:

Could this be read aloud to a regulator or senior bioinformatician without embarrassment?

If not, revise.

---

## Strategic objective

Most genomics companies say:

“Use our pipeline.”

Switzerland Omics says:

“Understand genomics correctly.”

Trust follows clarity.
Tools follow trust.

Technically sound. Incredibly simple.

```
```

Remember to:

First start by strategising about the content completely. 
Then review that plan. 
Then finally write up the new content for the page based on the plan. 
lastly start the output with a filename with underscore separators to copy paste such as `file_is_called.md`.
