How GRAIL emerged from sequencing research to build multi-cancer early detection tests, scaled through massive clinical studies, and became an independent public company.

Cancer screening historically detects only a few tumour types and usually only after symptoms appear. The operational bottleneck has been the absence of scalable methods to detect many cancers early in otherwise healthy people. Falling sequencing costs created a possibility, but practical methods were missing.

The turning point came unexpectedly during Illumina’s work on non-invasive prenatal testing around 2014–2015. Sequencing blood samples sometimes revealed genomic abnormalities originating not from the fetus but from undiagnosed cancers in pregnant women. This observation showed circulating tumour DNA could be detected in blood.

Illumina spun out a dedicated company in 2015–2016 to pursue this discovery, naming it GRAIL, referencing the ambition of finding a practical blood test for early cancer detection. Richard Klausner, former director of the US National Cancer Institute and then Illumina executive, helped champion the effort and joined the board.

Rather than targeting one cancer, the company shifted strategy toward detecting many simultaneously, creating what became known as multi-cancer early detection, or MCED.

The technical foundation combines cell-free DNA sequencing, detection of methylation patterns associated with cancer, machine learning classification, and prediction of tumour tissue origin. Achieving useful performance required enormous training datasets, driving GRAIL to build one of the largest clinical research programmes in cancer screening.

Key studies included PATHFINDER, SUMMIT, and a partnership with NHS England that enrolled roughly 140,000 participants, one of the largest screening trials of its type. Operations expanded to Menlo Park, California, and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, alongside large laboratory automation investments.

Commercial launch came in June 2021 with the Galleri test, designed to detect signals from more than 50 cancers using a single blood sample. The test is intended for adults at elevated cancer risk and must be followed by conventional diagnostics if signals are detected. It operates as a laboratory developed test under CLIA regulation rather than FDA approval.

Adoption has grown through employer benefit programmes, insurer pilots, pharmaceutical collaborations, and government partnerships, although widespread reimbursement remains unresolved. Revenue reached roughly USD 126 million in 2024, while heavy research, infrastructure, and commercial rollout costs produced losses near USD 2 billion, reflecting the expense of building population-scale screening infrastructure at a scale typically accessible only to well-capitalised platform-backed companies.

Rapid growth also brought challenges. In 2023, around 400 patients were incorrectly notified of possible cancer due to a software configuration issue in a partner system. Former employees filed workplace culture lawsuits, and clinical performance debates emerged, with some commentators arguing early results were overinterpreted. Sensitivity and false positive management remain active areas of study.

Meanwhile, Illumina reacquired GRAIL in 2021, triggering regulatory conflict that later forced divestment. In June 2024, GRAIL was spun off as an independent public company, trading as NASDAQ: GRAL, with Illumina retaining a minority stake.

The long-term significance of GRAIL lies in attempting to move genomics beyond diagnosis into preventive medicine. The company helped establish multi-cancer early detection as a new screening category, combining sequencing, machine learning, and population-scale clinical data.

Whether MCED testing ultimately becomes routine healthcare infrastructure remains uncertain. Success depends on improving accuracy, reducing cost, achieving reimbursement, and demonstrating clinical benefit at scale.

The durable lesson is that sequencing technology enabled a new possibility. Turning discovery into population-level healthcare, however, requires operational, regulatory, and economic execution far beyond technical innovation alone. Progress can also slow as programmes move from founder-led experimentation into the operational complexity of large corporate structures.
