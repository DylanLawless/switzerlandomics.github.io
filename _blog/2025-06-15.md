Why we organise our own work on a dedicated page.

As we grow, one principle must remain non-negotiable: our company will always maintain a dedicated unpolluted page to organise and host our own technical white papers, application notes, and peer-reviewed publications. 
These may be published in journals, as they should be, but they must also be accessible in one place through our website. 
This is not just a matter of structure but of brand clarity and communication integrity.

In most biotech companies, it is common for technical content to be mixed with third-party literature. 
Often, internal research is scattered or blended into general resources pages, usually managed by technical writers, marketing, or support teams.
While well-meaning, this dilutes the message.
I believe this practice weakens the clarity of the company's voice. 
It blurs the line between what the company has built and what others have said about it.

We take a different view.

As a service to investors, directors, and collaborators, we commit to a clean, central space that reflects our technical thinking. 
It is not a library of external references. 
It is a focused archive of the work we have done, the data we have generated, and the science we stand behind.

We have seen how leading AI companies publish not only working models but also supporting technical papers directly on their homepages. 
This format builds trust and reveals the vision behind the product without requiring interpretation. 
It is transparent and it is effective.

We will do the same. 
The work must speak for itself, and it must be easy to find. 
This reflects who we are, how we work, and what we value.
