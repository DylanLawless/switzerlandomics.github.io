Preventing war for the Genomic Century

The genomic century can flourish if we prevent the coming war.
The recent Nature coverage of the “Make America Healthy Again” summit shows how easily health policy can drift into a cultural struggle.
Groups across society are forming their own stories about what health should look like, which voices deserve trust, and which institutions should be questioned.
If this continues unchecked, it will solidify into a conflict between world views, each convinced the other threatens its way of life.

Carl Sagan’s The Demon Haunted World reminds us that fear thrives in the shadows.
His message was simple.
Shine light into the dark corners through clarity, openness, and shared understanding, and confusion loses its power.
The same holds true here.
Trust grows when information is open, when methods are visible, and when everyone can see how decisions are made.

Although the public are not yet fluent in the language of genomics, it is the foundation of how our bodies work and will soon become part of everyday vocabulary.
By reading small differences in our DNA, genomics can safely and privately reveal both the major inherited conditions that shape our health and identity, and the finer, more subtle features that we can easily adjust.
It can show where serious genetic risks may lie, and how our bodies respond to food, exercise, medicines, and daily habits.

An example makes this concrete.
A single genetic variant can change how a protein folds, which can influence how a cell works.
The scientific evidence for this can come from many places, whether from open public databases or from a patented commercial algorithm.
A shared community guideline would set a transparent baseline for how such evidence is checked.
It would show which data are acceptable, how results are verified, and how conclusions are reached, regardless of who produced the analysis.
This gives everyone a common language for trust.

Used well, genomics gives people clearer, more personal guidance so they can make choices that suit their goals and support their wellbeing.
It is not political.
It is a practical tool that can serve many different preferences.

Preventing a cultural divide means recognising that the public, industry, academia, and healthcare all want progress, but trust it for different reasons.
Some look for open research databases.
Others seek strict privacy and personalised care.
These aims can coexist if we set shared standards that guarantee a minimal, verifiable level of trust in every genomic result.

With such a foundation, each group can work in its own way while staying compatible with the rest of the system.
Many people have understandable reasons for distrusting past experts, especially when their views did not align politically.
The divide is not only political.
It includes longstanding differences between public and private institutions and the economic pressures that shape their work.
The British Society for Genetic Medicine recently warned that many direct to consumer tests are unreliable and that NHS analysis remains the safest option.
This is sensible, yet commercial tools are advancing quickly and AI will accelerate their progress.
Rather than dismiss them, we should evaluate every service, public or private, by the evidence that supports it.

Listening to the full range of voices across the population is essential if we want a system that feels fair to everyone.
A shared framework makes this possible.
It lowers the temperature, supports many styles of progress, and prevents one cultural or institutional view from overpowering another.
This is the purpose of the Swiss Genomics Association.
By publishing open, national scale guidelines and standards, we aim to build a transparent and verifiable foundation for genomics that can serve all communities in the decades ahead.
