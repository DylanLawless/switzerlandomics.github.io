**Post text (ideas and insights)**

Oh, fun. Thermo Fisher Scientific made a couple of offers for QIAGEN back in 2019 but an activist investor killed it. CEO Thierry is retiring so ideal situation for a deal that could close this time. Usual other suspects are Danaher Corporation, Agilent Technologies and bioMérieux.

BUT BUT BUT how about Illumina – this would fit perfectly with Jacob's vision for total vertical NGS integration from sample to answer 🤯🤯🤯

* Qiagen dominates sample prep and it sits upstream of every sequencing run and is an increasing portion of total cost and time. $6B+ market growing 15%. QIAGEN is the market leader covering the shebang: blood, tissue, FFPE samples, liquid biopsy…

* Qiagen bioinformatics perfectly complements Illumina DRAGEN. DRAGEN strength is secondary analysis and Qiagen is the industry gold standard for variant interpretation, pathways affected, upstream regulators, disease associations.

* QIAGEN generates 90% recurring revenue with ~30% operating margins – a complementary razor-razorblade model.

* Moat. With Roche entering sequencing and Element/Ultima commoditizing core sequencing, competing on workflow completeness beats competing on seq price alone.

* Right CEO and the right place – Jacob came from Agilent, where sample prep and workflow solutions are the core business. He knows this game and OMG he's DANISH 🍻

* Illumina market cap 3× that of Qiagen so not a merger of equals, Illumina will rule, so Jacob will rule, nice timing Q has no CEO problem.

* Mathing the math: Illumina now: $4.3B revenue, flat growth, 23% operating margins, 65–70% recurring revenue, and a China problem.
  Illumina + Qiagen: $6.4B revenue, return to 2–3% growth, pathway to 28%+ margin, and a way better 75%+ recurring revenue base. Qiagen's 90% consumables model is 🔥 – predictable, sticky, growing. Gonna have to borrow a ton but has plenty of cash flow to service that.

* Antitrust might not be so bad – very different situation to GRAIL as this is an existing market that's competitive, and isn't a market Illumina dominates as a supplier like liquid biopsy. Current US administration doesn't seem to have a political interest here – not a "free speech" issue. But EU may not be very receptive right now (cough, Greenland) to US entity buying EU assets but most if not all bidders are going to be US-based anyway 🤔 🤔 🤔

Jan 20 (Reuters) – Qiagen (QIA.DE) is weighing strategic options, including a potential sale of the diagnostics firm amid fresh takeover interest, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

U.S.-listed shares of the company were up more than 16% in afternoon trade.

The Netherlands-based company is working with advisers as its supervisory board fields preliminary interest from potential suitors, the report said, adding Qiagen has held talks with several possible buyers in recent weeks, including some U.S. strategics.

The company declined to comment on the report.

In recent years, the company has attracted multiple instances of takeover, though the discussions never led to a deal. Deliberations are still at an early stage and there is no certainty that the latest talks will result in a sale, the Bloomberg report said.

Qiagen said in November its Chief Executive Officer Thierry Bernard will leave as soon as a successor is found. His planned departure removes one of the biggest perceived roadblocks to a potential deal, according to some sources cited in the report.
