Qiagen takeover scenarios and industry speculation notes

update 1

Oh, fun. Thermo Fisher Scientific made a couple of offers for QIAGEN back in 2019 but an activist investor killed it. CEO Thierry is retiring so ideal situation for a deal that could close this time. Usual other suspects are Danaher Corporation, Agilent Technologies and bioMérieux.

BUT BUT BUT how about Illumina, this would fit perfectly with Jacob's vision for total vertical NGS integration from sample to answer 🤯🤯🤯

update 2
Ha! Credible source tells me they saw Illumina's Jacob Thaysen walking around with Peer Schatz, QIAGEN's ex-CEO at JPM last week. Quite the coincidence 😅😅😅


update 3
Or, maybe Roche buys QIAGEN to complement SBX, and to keep it away from Illumina. Probably no antitrust issues, EU happy.

Endless possibilities 👏👏👏
