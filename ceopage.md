Someone on your clinical or technical team has recommended Switzerland Omics for more advanced genomics.

They were likely persuaded by the rigour, transparency, and statistical clarity of our methods. The systems are built to support decision-making that is accountable, explainable, and aligned with the principles of clinical genetics.

Here is what that means for you.

**Designed for precision medicine from first principles**

Switzerland Omics addresses a structural problem in variant interpretation: methods are often fragmented, heuristic, and difficult to audit. We take a different approach, based on statistical modelling grounded in Bayesian probability. Our framework quantifies not only observed findings but also unobserved and uncertain elements, enabling a principled estimate of what the data supports, what it cannot exclude, and where uncertainty remains.

This allows each result to be evidence-calibrated, traceable, and compatible with evolving data resources.

**Independent implementation, full technical control**

All core methods are developed in-house, from curated datasets to the probabilistic inference systems that support interpretation and reporting. Where appropriate, we incorporate open-source tools that form part of the established omics infrastructure, provided they are transparent, documented, and stable for use. We do not license commercial third-party pipelines or depend on black-box systems. The models we provide are those we use ourselves with public evaluation and reporting.

Documentation is openly available, and all logic is reproducible. You will always be able to understand how conclusions were derived.

**Standards-aligned, audit-capable**

Switzerland Omics operates as a precision system. Every component, from source code to variant database to financial documentation, is versioned and traceable. Models are developed in line with recognised clinical and statistical standards, and are structured for compatibility with research and regulatory review.

Our algorithms and datasets are built to support reproducible, independent audit by the clinical and technical teams that apply them in practice.

---

**Transparent terms, long-term use**

We offer full technical access under clear terms, without lllsage-based pricing or feature gating. Support is matched to the operational needs. Outputs follow open formats, with consistent structure and clear specification for downstream integration.

There are no dependencies that restrict use or reuse. Data can be exported, validated, and incorporated into other systems without modification.

**Further materials and contact**

We publish validation work, data model specifications, and clinical report examples for review. 
All documentation is available online.
