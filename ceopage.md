Someone on your clinical or technical team just recommended Switzerland Omics for genomic variant interpretation or diagnostics.

It was easy to convince them. Our approach is technically rigorous, clinically explainable, and designed to make sense from first principles. It's built for professionals who value clarity, precision, and accountability.

Here's why you should follow their recommendation.

---

**Built for precision medicine from day one**

Switzerland Omics was founded to address a fundamental gap: variant interpretation today is fragmented, heuristic, and often reactive. Our solution is based on stringent statistical modelling with Bayesian probability, integrating observed and unobserved evidence to yield decisive, transparent answers.

We focus on accuracy and auditability, not hype. Our methods quantify what can be known, what is missing, and what can never be concluded, so that each clinical result is fully evidence-aware.

---

**Independent, accountable, and trustworthy**

We are not a wrapper on someone else's pipeline. We own the full stack — from variant datasets to probabilistic reasoning frameworks — and build everything in-house.
We use our own models clinically, and all methods are openly documented and reproducible.

We're not trying to sell a mystery. You'll know how every conclusion was made.

---

**Regulatory-ready, data-proven**

We follow best practices for variant classification, ACMG standards, and population-scale statistical modelling. Our frameworks have been validated on national cohorts and are aligned with clinical guidelines.
We support reproducible audits and technical reports that can be reviewed by both researchers and regulators.

---

**Clear pricing, honest support, no lock-in**

We don't charge per click or hide features behind pricing tiers. Whether you're a single hospital or a national lab, you'll get full access to our platform with transparent pricing and straightforward support.
Our outputs are standardised, open-format, and designed for integration, not entrapment.
